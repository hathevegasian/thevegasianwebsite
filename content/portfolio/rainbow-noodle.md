Hey, does my Vietnamese salad dressing recipe still ring a bell?

In that recipe, I spilled the beans that you can stash the dressing away for a good two weeks. Now, you might be pondering what to do if you don't quite fancy a salad within that span. Toss the dressing? Nah, not necessary!

I've got your back! This dressing isn't a one-trick pony. Sure, it's awesome on salads, but it's also a killer match for noodles.

Ready for a quick lesson? Let's dive in!
