It was my first attempt at making brioche, all in pursuit of crafting this dish. Thomas, rarely one to give out perfect scores, surprised me with a resounding 10 out of 10 for the flawless brioche. This unexpected praise set me on a mission to perfect the art of brioche-making.

Unfortunately, my subsequent attempts didn't quite match the initial success, but I'm determined to keep experimenting until I can achieve that perfect 10 brioche again.

However, if you'd rather spare yourself the trouble, I recommend opting for store-bought vegan brioche. The rest of the dish is a breeze to prepare.

So, let's jump right into it!
