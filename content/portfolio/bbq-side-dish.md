Dưa Giá, or pickled bean sprouts, isn't your typical barbecue side dish, but rather a staple in Vietnamese cuisine. However, thanks to its subtly sweet and sour flavors, I've discovered it makes for a delightful companion to those hearty barbecue feasts.

This recipe is a breeze to whip up, and it's a hit with the kids too. So, without further ado, let's roll up our sleeves and head straight to the kitchen!

ingredients="125g bean sprouts# 1 carrot - julienne# 50g (garlic) chives# 1 shallot - slices# (optional) red pepper slices# 500ML water# 1 tsp sea salt# 1/4 cup vinegar# 1/4 cup sugar" 
instructions="In a sauce pan, mix the water with salt, vinegar, sugar and bring it to boil# Once boiled, cook the broth for 5 minutes then turn off the heat and let it cool down totally# In a salad bowl, add the bean sprouts, carrot, and chives together then mix them gently with your hand# Transfer the veggies to a sterilized jar layer by layer# Add the shallot and pepper slices between the layers until you run out of it# Pour in the cooled down broth until the veggies are totally covered#  Close the jar with a lid and let the jar sit on your counter top for about a day# After a day, transfer the jar to the fridge to stop the fermentation process"
notes="Always keep the jar in the fridge after use# You should only use a clean pair of chopsticks/material to take a small part out for usage, keep the rest clean in the fridge# If you like to have a more sour version of Dưa Giá then let it sit longer on the counter top before transfer them to the fridge">}}
