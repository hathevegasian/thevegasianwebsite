I'm a huge fan of kimchi, no doubt about it. But living in the Netherlands, it's a bit of a conundrum. You're faced with a choice: either spend hours whipping up a batch of kimchi from scratch or shell out a small fortune for a tiny jar of the good stuff.

During a family visit with my in-laws, our lovely uncle Jos dropped a real gem. He likened kimchi to spicy sauerkraut, and I thought, "What a clever idea!"

With this recipe, I've found a way to cut the kimchi-making time down to a third. And if you want to save even more time, you can use gochujang paste instead of making your own kimchi sauce.

Curious? Let's dive in.

preptime="5 MIN" 
cooktime="5 MIN" 
totaltime="10 MIN" 
servings="1" 
ingredients="1 bag of natural sauerkraut ~ 520g# 2 large tb gochujang paste# at least 2 tb of garlic paste# 1 large onion# 1 handfull spring onion" 
instructions="Peel and blend the onion into a smooth paste# Cut the spring onion into strips of 5cm# In a mixing bowl, pour in all the ingredients and mix them well# Store the kimchi in a sterilized jar and put them immediately in the fridge"
notes="Since the sauerkraut is already fermented, you can enjoy your kimchi right away# If the sauerkraut is too sour, you can add a bit of sugar to weaken the sour taste# The more garlic and onion paste you put into the sauerkraut, the more it tastes like kimchi# Add more gochugaru if you want extra spicy">}}
