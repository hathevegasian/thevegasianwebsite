What sets Vietnamese salads apart from their Western counterparts? The answer is simple: herbs, herbs, and more herbs.

In our salads, we not only embrace the abundance of herbs but also relish the crunch of vegetables and fruits (like carrots, mangoes, papayas, and more).

I know that it's sometimes quite challenging to find affordable Asian ingredients for your salad. That's why I'm here to introduce a commendable alternative â€“ one that might not be on your radar but holds significant popularity in Vietnamese salad-making: kohlrabi.

Let's roll up our sleeves and dive right in!

notes="Each type of herbs will give you a slightly different result# If you cannot find Vietnamese coriander, you can replace it with mint or shiso# Replace tofu with pan fried mushrooms for a soy-free version">}}
