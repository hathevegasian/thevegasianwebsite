With a surplus of soybeans at home awaiting consumption, I couldn't conceive of a more fitting option than this delightful kongguksu noodles! 

If you've been following my journey, you're likely aware of my profound admiration for all things Korean, and this noodle delicacy unquestionably tops the charts.

However, I've introduced a minor tweak to the recipe based on the ingredients at hand, resulting in an astonishing fusion of flavors. 


So, let's get started!


{{< recipe

ingredients="noodles of choice# 1/2 cup soy bean# 1 tb pine nuts# 1 tb sesame seeds & a tiny bit for garnishing# 3.5 cups water# 1 to 2 tb Maggi# shiso leaves# (optional) chili peppers" 
instructions="Soak the soy bean overnight in the water# Pan fry the pine nuts together with sesame seeds without oil on medium heat until it's slightly brown# Strain and rinse the soaked soy bean under cold water then cook it for 15 minutes# When the 15 minutes is up, remove the excess water and transfer the beans to a blender# Blend the soy bean, roasted pine nuts, sesame seeds and water until smooth# Transfer the soy mixture into a container and keep it cool in the fridge until serving# Before serving, season the soy mixture with the Maggi sauce# Place the noodles in a soup bowl, pour the soy mixture into the bowl, garnish with the shiso leaves, chili peppers, and sesame seeds " 
notes="Do not cover the pan during cooking the soy bean, You can also try to make the original version by serving the noodle with julienne cucumber and cherry tomatos instead of shiso leaves. Don't forget to replace the Maggi with salt only">}}
