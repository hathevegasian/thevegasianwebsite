The original plan was to incorporate regular chestnuts into this dish, but I couldn't find them anywhere yet. Coincidentally, I had a can of water chestnuts at home, and an idea struck me â€“ why not use them as an alternative?

The outcome turned out to be surprisingly delicious. While water chestnuts don't have the creamy consistency of regular chestnuts, their juicy texture still pairs wonderfully in this recipe with a steaming bowl of rice.

Since then, this dish has become my go-to choice whenever I'm deciding what to whip up in a large batch to pack for lunch at work the next day.

If you haven't had the pleasure of trying water chestnuts before, I highly recommend giving this dish a shot! You'll fall in love with it from the very first bite.
