Xá xíu, or charsiu, might be a Cantonese classic, but here in Vietnam, especially in our vibrant Vietnamese-Cantonese community in Saigon's bustling Chinatown, it's a beloved part of our food culture. I've grown up relishing the fusion of Vietnamese and Cantonese flavors, and it's a tradition that's close to my heart.

Typically, crafting the perfect batch of sticky rice can be a 2-day affair, involving overnight soaking, a 20-minute steam, cooling, and then another steam, a technique known as double steaming. The waiting period between steaming sessions can vary, sometimes stretching for half a day.

In this recipe, I'm thrilled to introduce you to a quicker method for making sticky rice. Even if you take the rice out of the fridge the next day, it will remain soft upon reheating, avoiding that undesirable hardening. All you need is a handy rice cooker.

No need to wait any longer – let's get cooking!

notes="Make sure that you remove all the water before transfering the rice to the rice cooker otherwise your sticky rice might be mushy# You should adjust the amount of sauces to mix with the mushroom since every charsiu powder brand will taste differently. You can mix the sauce, cook them in a pan to taste first then marinate the mushroom later">}}
