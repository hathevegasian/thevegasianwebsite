Xá xíu or charsiu is actually a Cantonese dish. However, the Vietnamese-Cantonese community in Vietnam is really big. We have a humongous Chinatown called Chợ Lớn in Saigon. I grew up eating fusion food of the Vietnamese and Cantonese cuisine and it roots deep down my heart the love for this tradition.

Usually, to make a perfect batch of sticky rice it may take up to 2 days. You will have to soak the rice overnight, steam it once for about 20 minutes, let it cool down then steam the rice once again. This technique is called double steaming. The waiting time between two steaming slots depends on how quick the rice cool down. Sometime this process can take half a day.

In this recipe, I'm so happy to introduce you a quicker method making sticky rice that even when you take the rice out of the fridge the day after, it will still be soft after warming up without getting harden. All you need is a rice cooker.

Let's jump right in!
