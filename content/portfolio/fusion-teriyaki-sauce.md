Who could have thought that balsamic vinegar could level up your  homemade teriyaki sauce? 

A while back, I received a bottle of exquisite balsamic vinegar that has remained largely untouched.  In the realm of Vietnamese cuisines, balsamic vinegar seldom finds its place. Yet, as a staunch advocate against food waste, I was determined to fashion a remedy.  And voil√†, the birth of this ingenious recipe!
