servings="20" 
ingredients="150g raw pumpkin# 5 tb sugar# 1 cup glutinous flour# 1 cup tapioca flour# 1/4 cup + 5 tb water + sesame seeds for coating# cooking oil for frying" 
instructions="Peel, deseed, and slice the pumpkin into 1cm thick slices then steam it until fork tender# When the pumpkin is cooked, mix it well with the sugar# Add the two types of flour into the pumpkin paste following with the water# Mix everything well until it forms a smooth dough# Divide the dough into small balls# Flatten each ball then coat them with sesame seeds# Fry the pumpkin pieces in a heated oil until it floats on top# Take the cookie out and let them sit on top of a kitchen paper to remove excess oil"
notes="Adjust the amount of sugar to your taste# Add more water when your dough is too dry. You can test it by coating a small piece with sesame seeds. If the seeds can easily stick to the dough then the dough is good. But if the seeds fall off all the time, you should add more water# The snack will be hard the day after but you can just pop them in the airfryer for 5 minutes at 200ºC then it's all good">}}
