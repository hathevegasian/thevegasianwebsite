If you're a fan of mochi, you're likely to adore this dish. Bánh Dày is a popular Vietnamese street food crafted from glutinous rice flour. Its delightful chewy texture, combined with the umami from Chả Lụa (Vietnamese cold sausage) and the seasoning of salt and pepper, makes it an addictive snack.

It's incredibly easy to make, but you'll need to exercise some patience and allow them to cool down completely before digging in. However, I promise you, the wait will be worth it because you're in for the best snack ever!

Let's dive right into the recipe!

totaltime="15 MIN" 
servings="4" 
ingredients="200g glutinous rice flour# 1 tsp salt# 10ml vegetable oil# 100ml boiling water# 50ml tap water" 
instructions="Mix the flour with the salt together# Slowly add the boiling water# Kneed the dough thoroughly then add the oil and the rest of tap water# When you see almost no dry flour anymore then kneed the dough with your clean hands until you can shape a smooth shiny ball# Divide the dough into 8 balls of around 40g# Flatten out each ball with your palm# Place the flattened Bánh Dày pieces in the steam basket, remember to give them generous gap between each piece cause they will expand# Steam the cake for a good 10 minutes# When the time is up, brush a thin layer of oil on top of the cake, cover them with a lid and let it cool down totally"
notes="To enjoy the dish, sprinkle a tiny bit of salt and pepper on two pieces of Bánh Dày then sandwich a thick piece of vegan Viet sausage between the cakes# The perfect dough to work with is soft enough when you press it but it can still stand on the counter by itself without melting down. When you see a crack when you break the dough, it means that you have to add more water">}}
