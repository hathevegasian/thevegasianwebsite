People often overlook the potential for personal growth hidden within everyday activities, like cooking. You don't have to commit to a three-minute daily meditation to cultivate focus â€“ making mayak gimbap can do the trick.

No need to pile up books by Thich Nhat Hanh in hopes of absorbing patience from his words. Making mayak gimbap is your ticket.

Fail to be mindful while crafting these rolls, you might end up with a messy, broken concoction, or worse, rolls that refuse to close. And if patience isn't your strong suit, those tiny gimbap rolls might just drive you nuts.

From the moment I embraced my love for cooking, I noticed how much I've grown through it. So, if you're on the hunt for personal growth avenues, why not give cooking a shot?
