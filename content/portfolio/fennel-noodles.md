Fennel seeds play a crucial role in making Pho, yet I must confess I never got to taste the vegetable itself until I moved to the Netherlands.

The seeds, combined with other herbs, are undeniably amazing. However, it took me years to truly appreciate the taste of the root and gradually fall in love with it.

After experimenting with various veggies, I discovered that I love the flavor of fennel slices cooked with fresh tomato and garlic the most.

The umami of tomato and the robust flavor of garlic work together to elevate the fennel.

If you're in the mood for a simple, light, yet flavorful fennel dish, I highly recommend giving this recipe a try!
