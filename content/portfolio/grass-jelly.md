Grass jelly, a dessert with a jelly-like texture, is crafted from a plant known as Chinese mesona, part of the mint family. In Vietnamese, it goes by the name (thạch) sương sáo. Sương sáo brings its unique herbal flavor to the table, making it a perfect match for coconut-infused desserts or the classic bubble milk tea.

Back in the day, before the advent of the canned version, crafting sương sáo required boiling the stalks and leaves until a starchy concoction formed. Then, you'd let it chill in the fridge for hours until it set. With technology stepping in, the scratch-making process took a back seat. Grass jelly powder hit the shelves, enabling folks to easily prepare it following the instructions on the package. Nowadays, various brands offer canned grass jelly, a time-saving alternative.

Now, for this particular recipe, I've got you covered with ingredients you can snag from Amazing Oriental (the Netherlands' biggest Asian store chain) or any Asian store nearby.

Let's not waste any more time – let's jump straight into it!
