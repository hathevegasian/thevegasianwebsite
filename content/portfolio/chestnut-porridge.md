Recently, I watched a Netflix show about Korean banchan (side dishes) and got inspired by their chestnut porridge. With autumn still around the corner and chestnut being a great idea for Christmas dinner, I decided to share this recipe.

I aimed to utilize the natural sweetness from vegetables, keeping the seasoning simple with just salt. I cooked this dish with a slow cooker but you can totally cook them normally on regular cooking plate or even speed the process up with instant pot.

I hope this recipe adds a delightful touch to your meal! Enjoy!
