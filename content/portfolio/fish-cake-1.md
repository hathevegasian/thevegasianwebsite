Seitan, also known as wheat gluten, has been documented in China since the 6th century, and it has been widely embraced in Vietnam as a meat substitute.

Interestingly, in recent years, seitan has witnessed a surge in popularity across Western countries. In the Netherlands, you can conveniently acquire ready-made seitan from my friend's venture, Wheat. Pray. Love Amsterdam. Their creative array of options is bound to leave you astonished.

For those of you who relish adventure and wish to craft seitan from scratch, you can order wheat gluten powder from De Notenshop – an online haven for wheat-related products in the Netherlands, which happens to be my personal favorite.

Typically, seitan carries a rather neutral flavor profile. However, I've finally discovered a recipe that will enchant your taste buds with its seafood-like essence and satisfying chewiness.

notes="The fish cakes will be swollen when you fry them but they will sink down after you take them out. This process makes the fish cakes become more airy# You can also pan fry the fish cakes with less oil but you will not get the airy version. Both versions have its own unique texture so you can play along with your creativity# In Vietnam, we usually serve fish cakes with hot sauce as a snack# Check out the next post to know how I prepare the fish cakes as a main dish for our homemade meal">}}
