I'm absolutely hooked on the flavor of Beyond Meat, and when you pair it with aubergine stew, the magic happens. That's why I've dubbed this creation "Beyond Aubergine."

The vegan mince's hearty texture mingles with the rich umami of the aubergine, and a sprinkle of shiso takes the dish to a whole new realm.

When you're in the mood for a speedy recipe to complement a steaming bowl of white rice, your quest ends right here. This is the answer you've been looking for!

notes="Make sure that the Beyond Meat and aubergine is well cooked before you add the sauce mixture# Since we mix the corn starch directly with the other sauce, it is going to thicken the sauce real quick. It is better to keep the heat on low to get a full control of this process">}}
