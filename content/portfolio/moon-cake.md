Tết Trung Thu, also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival, is a traditional celebration shared by various cultures, including Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean, among others. In Korea, the Mid-Autumn Festival ranks among the most significant and revered holidays. Meanwhile, in Vietnam, while it's a notable festival, it tends to be more festive than formal. The festive spirit is palpable as mooncakes and lanterns become ubiquitous, but it doesn't carry the same weight as our Tết - Lunar New Year festival.

Unlike Tết, which boasts strict customs and traditions, Tết Trung Thu offers a bit more leeway. If you're not in the mood for mooncakes one year, it's no big deal.

Nevertheless, the festival's presence is felt throughout the entire month. Mooncakes are sold everywhere, starting exceptionally early. As the festival draws to a close, you'll find incredible discounts on mooncakes, sometimes even a "buy 1 get 5 free" deal. Wondering why? Well, mooncakes are a seasonal delight, exclusively available during this time of year. Once the festival concludes, vendors have no use for leftover cakes. So, they opt to sell them at rock-bottom prices to: 1. combat food waste, 2. clear out stock for a fresh start next year, and 3. because mooncakes don't have a long shelf life, making them unsuitable for extended sales.

I make it a personal tradition to craft and sell mooncakes each year. While I hadn't initially planned to continue the tradition in 2023, I ultimately decided to go ahead with it. If you're a fan of these delectable cakes, check the link in my Instagram bio to place an order.

Now, without further ado, let's dive right into the recipe for pumpkin mooncakes!

instructions="!The filling:# Soak the mung bean in cold water in 1 hour# Steam the pumpkin until fork tender# Mix the cooked glutinous flour with the oil and set it aside# After 1 hour, cook the mung bean with 200ml water until soften# Transfer the cooked mung bean into a hand mixer then add the steamed pumpkin# Blend the mung bean and pumpkin until smooth and transfer it to a frying pan# Add the sugar into the mixture# Stir the mixture of mung bean and pumpkin frequently on low heat until all the water evaporates# Slowly add the oil mixture into the filling pan, divide it into 3 times# When the filling is firmed, add the pumkin seeds# Transfer the filling to a small bowl and cover it with plastic wrap until it's cooled down# ! The crust:# Mix the dry ingredients well before adding the wet ingredients# Mix the dough thoroughly until you can form a ball# Let it sit for at least 30 minutes# ! Forming the cakes:# Divide the fillings into 3 balls, each ball is 55g# Divide the dough also into 3 balls, each bal is 20g# Flatten the crust dough with your dough roller# Hold the crust dough in your palm, add the filling ball on top, then flip the crust ball upside down# When the crust dough is flipped, carefully close the crust and cover the whole filling ball# Smoothen the beautifully wrapped moon cake by rolling them with your hand and let it rest until you are done with all three cakes# Dust the moon cake form with a layer of flour then add the moon cake ball one by one into the form# Press down the mould and hold it tightly for at least 3 seconds so the cake can hold its form# Slowly take the cake out of the form and transfer it to a baking tray# ! Baking:# Preheat your oven to 200°C# Bake the cakes at 200°C in 10 minutes# After 10 minutes are up, take the cakes out, spray some water to help them cool down# When the cakes are totally cooled down, brush some vegan milk on top then pop them again into the oven for another 10 minutes at 180°C# When the cakes are done, let them sit for at least one day before enjoy"
notes="The smaller cakes will need lower temperature ad shorter time to bake# If you are making the bigger cakes, just take 7 part filling : 2 part crust. For my mould, it was 75g so I made 7 part filling = 55g and 2 part crust = 20g. You can also try out with 5:5 if this is the first time you make moon cakes# It is crucial that you let the cakes cool down totally before baking the second time# It is better to start with lower temperature and longer baking time than higher temperature and shorter baking time. Every oven is different so you should adjust the temperature accordingly to your oven# It is important that you wrap the crust tightly around the filling and let no air get in between them otherwise the filling will fall of the crust after baking and the cakes cannot hold its form">}}
