In our previous recipe, I walked you through crafting the fish cake from scratch. Today, let's embark on a culinary journey and explore my preferred method of turning these fish cakes into a standout main course.

Apart from the classic way of serving these fish cakes with a side of white rice, we Vietnamese folks also have a soft spot for enjoying them tucked into our beloved Bánh Mì.

So, without further ado, let's roll up our sleeves and dive into today's fish cake stew adventure!
