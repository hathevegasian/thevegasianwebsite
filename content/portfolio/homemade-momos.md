Back in July, during our Belgium getaway, we stumbled upon this Tibetan restaurant that got me totally into making momos at home.

With Thomas' birthday on the horizon this week, I initially planned to whip up a Mongolian twist. However, navigating their cuisine's vegan adaptation posed a challenge. Thus, I've pivoted to crafting momos, drawing inspiration from the delectable Tibetan ones we savored in Adennes.

Despite having dabbled in dumpling-making since my culinary journey began, this  was still my first time crafting momos with heartier wrappers. The outcome was delightful, and I picked up a handful of tricks that can help you succeed right on the first try.

No more waiting â€“ let's jump right in and get cooking!

preptime="60 MIN" 
cooktime="20 MIN" 
totaltime="1 HOUR 20 MIN" 
servings="36" 
ingredients="4 cups flour# 1 1/3 cups boiling water# 1/4 tsp salt# 1 carrot# 100g red cabbage# 1 handful soy protein pieces - soaked in cold water# 1 handful wood ear mushroom - soaked in cold water# 1 large onion# 50g ginger# spring onion# 1 tb sesame oil# 1 tb Lee Kum Kee mushroom sauce# 1 tsp salt# 1 tsp MSG" 
instructions="Add the flour into a mixing bowl# Slowly add the water and mix well (start first with 1 cup then add more when needed)# When the dough is formed into a bowl, let it sit for at least 30 minutes# Mince the carrot, cabbage, soy protein, wood ear mushroom, onion, ginger and spring onion using a food processor # Add vegetables into a mixing bowl# Add the sauces and mix the filling well# On a clean surface, roll out the rested dough into a rectangle and use the cookies cutter to cut the dough into 36 equal circles for the wrappers# For each wrapper, add 1 tsp of filling and form them into a momo shape. Check out my Instagram for the instruction# Steam the momos in 20 minutes and enjoy with hot sauce or soy sauce"
notes="If you want to have some chunks to bite on for the filling then mince the veggies manually with a knife# In other to create a hole on top of the dumplings, it's better to close the momos first and then pinch the top together to create a closed hole # It's easier to roll out the wrapper as big as possible and add only about 1 tsp of filling when shaping the momos">}}
