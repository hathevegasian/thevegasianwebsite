Let's usher in the autumn months with a comforting bowl of pumpkin soup!

In a Vietnamese household, a homemade meal typically involves freshly cooked white rice, a meat dish, a vegetable dish, and/or a soup. Our soups tend to have a slightly watery consistency, perfect for mixing into rice or sipping casually after the main course.

Today's pumpkin soup is the rendition I grew up savoring. The meaty goodness of Beyond Meat, the natural sweetness of pumpkin, the herbaceous notes from culantro, along with the freshness of spring onion and a dash of black pepper, create a dish that's tailor-made for the upcoming rainy days of autumn.

Intrigued by the flavor profile? Let's not waste another moment â€“ head to the kitchen and let's get cooking!
