Hong Kong-style "egg" tarts are a snack straight from my childhood. My mouth starts watering automatically when I see someone enjoying one. I used to think that creating a vegan version of this treat was next to impossible.

But then, as luck would have it, while watching a recipe video for making bao buns, I noticed the chef crafting the "custard" filling without eggs as the main ingredient. That's when my creative side kicked in, and I decided to give this recipe a try without using any eggs. To my delight, it turned out to be a resounding success.

I also experimented with another version using sweet potatoes. Honestly, I prefer the look of the sweet potato version, as the "egg" layer appears even shinier. But when it comes to a quick and simple recipe, nothing beats this lion powder version.

If you can't find lion powder in your area, stay tuned for my sweet potato version in the future.

Now, let's dive into this recipe together!
