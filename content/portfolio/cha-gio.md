Chả Giò, unlike the street food snacks commonly munched on in the West, is a special treat in Vietnamese culture. It's the kind of dish that comes out when the whole family, and I mean all the cousins and aunties too, gets together.

Funny thing is, I used to not really vibe with Chả Giò because it felt so heavy. Like, eating it almost guaranteed feeling like a balloon. But then I went vegan, and suddenly, I'm cool with it. Maybe it was the meaty version that wasn't my jam?

There are loads of ways people make Chả Giò all over the country. Different regions have their own twists. Heck, they even call it different names depending on where you are. I grew up down South, so for me, it's Chả Giò all the way. But if you wander up Central, they call it Ram. Go way North, and it's Nem – which, by the way, the French call it, too.

Vietnamese cuisine's diversity is such that even those born in Vietnam might not be familiar with every dish from the country. A friend from Hanoi once grumbled about the non-Vietnamese Chả Giò wrappers in the Netherlands, unaware that a slightly different version awaited him as he journeyed further South.

The essence of this tale is simple: Chả Giò is an adaptable, multifaceted dish. You can tailor it to your taste preferences, as long as it's delicious.

So, without further ado, let me introduce you to one of my all-time favorite methods of crafting Chả Giò!

ingredients="12 sheets rice paper# 1/2 cup mung beans# 1 carrot# 1 handfull wood ear mushroom# 50g soaked vermicelli/glass noodles# spring onion# 1/2 tsp salt#  peppers" 
instructions="Soak the mung beans at least 4 hours# Soak the mushroom in cold water# After the beans are double the size, steam them for at least 20 minutes# In the meantime, julienne the carrots# Chop the soaked wood ear mushroom, vermicelli, and spring onion roughly# Add the cooked mung bean, julienned carrot, chopped mushroom, vermicelli, spring onion into a large mixing bowl# Add salt and pepper and mix the filling well# Wet the rice paper and place it on a straight surface# Add about 1tb of fillings and roll it tightly# Deep fry the rolls in oil"
notes="Make sure you got the right version of rice paper. I used the red package of the Bamboo Tree brand# After wrapping, you should let the rolls rest until the rice paper dries up to prevent oil explosion# Use the double frying technique to reach the perfect crunchiness# Always face the edge of the rolls down the oil first so they will not break while frying">}}
