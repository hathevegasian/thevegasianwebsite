While I was scrolling through TikTok, I came across this heartwarming video of an old lady making homemade mandu for her grandkids. The image stuck with me for days and got me thinking â€“ why not make some for my birthday week celebration?

I've tried making different types of dumplings before, but I never really ventured into making Korean ones. After all, the store-bought vegan ones are pretty good. But this time, I decided to give it a shot, and guess what? The final result beats the dumplings you find at the supermarket.

Let me know if you get as hooked on this recipe as I did!

cooktime="15 MIN" 
totaltime="45 MIN" 
servings="22" 
ingredients="1 package dumpling wrapper# 100g firm tofu# 50g soaked vermicelli/glass noodles# 1 handful soaked wood ear muswhroom# 1 handful garlic chives# 5-6 vegan shrimps# 1 tb Lee Kum Kee mushroom sauce# 1 tb soy sauce" 
instructions="Break or blend the tofu then add it to a mixing bowl# Finely chop the soaked vermicelli, mushrooms, chives, and vegan shrimps# Add the mushroom and soy sauce then mix the filling well# Dust a thin layer of flour on a tray or anything you use to store the dumplings after wrapping# For each dumpling, place 1 tb of the filling in the center of the wrapper# Wet the edge with some water then fold the dumpling into a half circle# Press the edge tightly to prevent breaking during cooking# Steam/ pan fry/ deep fried/ cook the mandu in veggies broth to make dumpling soup"
notes="You can choose the cooking option based on the wrappers' thickness. If the wrappers are thin then pan fry is the best technique but if they are thick then I recommend you to deep fry them# For the deep fried version, it is better to fry the dumplings first in the oil until they float to the top then take them out and continue the cooking in an air fryer to reduce excess fat">}}
