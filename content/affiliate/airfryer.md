I used to ponder a seemingly straightforward question: "If you already have an oven at home, why invest in an air fryer? Don't they serve the same purpose?"

Surprisingly, this question had more merit than I initially thought. While an air fryer does share similarities with an oven, its compact size provides several distinct advantages. Notably, it heats up rapidly and cooks or bakes your food in less time. Plus, being an "AIR" fryer, it lets you savor the crispy goodness of fried treats without the guilt of excessive oil consumption.

My husband Thomas and I have embraced the convenience of our trusty Philips air fryer for years now. However, there's one downside: the non-stick coating on the Philips model isn't exactly top-notch, making cleanup a genuine ordeal. If you're a cleaning enthusiast like me, I'd recommend using air fryer parchment liners or baking sheets to simplify the post-cooking cleanup process.

In my view, virtually any brand of air fryer will serve you well. While pricier models may offer faster cooking times, you can generally find one that aligns with your budget.
