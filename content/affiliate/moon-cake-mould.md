Baking mooncakes is truly an art form. It involves mastering various tips and tricks to achieve the perfect consistency for both the filling and the crust. Even shaping the cakes requires finesse.

Traditionally, mooncakes were shaped using wooden molds coated with a thin layer of flour. The process involved pressing the mixture tightly to form the cakes and then carefully extracting them by smashing the mold. However, this method often posed a risk of either getting the cakes stuck in the mold or accidentally damaging them during removal.

Fortunately, as time went by, a more user-friendly mooncake mold was invented, and I absolutely adore it. These modern molds feature a spring mechanism that makes it much easier to release the cakes, making them especially beginner-friendly.
